# SledProc-plus-ChasmVM (introduction)

Since roughly 2016, I have worked on a series of 
projects for a startup company called 
Linguistic Technology Systems, based in 
New Jersey.  Our initial focus 
was on native UI development, particularly 
for applications based on Qt.  Our premise was 
that many organizations were switching completely 
to web-based portals (which is different from 
providing web access as one user option in a 
hybrid application that also can run as a 
standalone desktop program) -- and that many 
applications suffered from degradation in quality 
and usability as a result.  (It's worth noting 
that many projects seem to be built as web apps 
even when intended to be run locally on one machine, 
essentially launching a separate HTTP server solely 
to support a single program's UI.)  We believed 
that improving the development workflow for native 
C++ software -- e.g., a wider range of prebuilt 
components for UI domains such as annotated video players, 
digital maps, PDF viewers, managing Image Processing piplines, 
etc.; plus embeddable and self-contained scripting, database, 
and cloud-integration capabilities -- and also offering 
embedded web viewers for content that does work best 
in a browser context (such as interactive SVG, or 360 photography 
via WebGL) would help developers transition from browser-based 
paradigms to a native and/or hybrid model, with better 
overall UX and responsiveness.
